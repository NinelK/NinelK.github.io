## About Me

---

I am currently a Royal Society University Research Fellow at the School of Informatics, University of Edinburgh (since January 2025).
I work in the field of NeuroAI -- an intersection between studies of natural and artificial intelligence. 

Drawing on my interdisciplinary background, I view intelligence as fundamentally linked to predictive processing and dynamic interaction with the environment. 
I am also interested in applying my research to understanding the mechanisms underlying autism spectrum disorders, and enabling effective decoding of movement for developing prosthetic devices and human-machine interfaces.
